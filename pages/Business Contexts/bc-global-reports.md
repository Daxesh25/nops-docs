## Pre-Built & Customizable Reports for nOps Business Contexts+ ##
nOps provides a selection of pre-built reports designed to cover common use cases and scenarios. These reports come with predefined filters and settings to help you quickly identify spending trends and optimization opportunities.

You can customize reports to save and share with team members. You can also automate the delivery of updated reports to recipients on a preset frequency (daily, weekly monthly…).

This help doc will cover how to get started and how to use the filters and settings available to you. It will also cover the different types of pre-built reports and how to use them.
