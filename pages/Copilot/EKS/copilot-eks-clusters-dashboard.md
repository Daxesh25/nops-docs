# Getting Started with Compute Copilot's EKS Page: Metrics & Management #

Get insights and metrics for all your EKS clusters on the EKS Clusters page in Compute Copilot to understand your cluster efficiency.  The Compute Copilot's EKS page provides quick access to key metrics for all your EKS clusters. From this page, you can navigate to individual clusters to configure them on nOps for Compute Copilot and Business Context+ (BC+), view container utilization metrics, and access rightsizing recommendations. This documentation will guide you through how to use the EKS page.

## What is Compute Copilot? ##

Compute Copilot is a powerful service designed to automatically optimize compute-based workloads, reducing costs on AWS EKS by intelligently migrating EC2 instances to Spot instances using machine learning algorithms.

Learn more about how Compute Copilot for EKS can help you to put your EKS cost optimization on auto-pilot [here](https://www.nops.io/compute-copilot/).

## What is Business Context+ (BC+)? ##

BC+ helps you understand and allocate 100% of your AWS costs, from your largest resources down to individual container costs. Click [here](https://www.nops.io/blog/introducing-business-contexts/) to learn more about BC+."%

{%include important.html content="Cost Breakdown, Cost Over Time, and Container Utilization metrics require [Business Contexts+ (BC+)](https://www.nops.io/blog/introducing-business-contexts/)."%}

Here's an explanation of each card:

### Cost Breakdown ###

![copilot-eks-cost-breakdown.png](/tmpimg/copilot-eks-cost-breakdown.png)

The Cost Breakdown chart on the EKS page provides a clear view of how costs are distributed across different components of your EKS clusters. This pie chart categorizes costs into several key areas, helping you understand where your budget is allocated. Here’s what each category represents:

* **CPU**: This section shows the costs associated with the compute instances used by your clusters. It includes expenses related to the number of virtual CPUs and the types of instances in use.

* **GPU**: This part highlights the costs for GPU resources utilized by your clusters. If your workloads use GPU instances, their associated costs are reflected here.

* **Memory**: This category covers the expenses related to the amount of RAM allocated to your clusters. It includes costs based on memory usage.

* **Storage**: This section represents the costs for various storage services, such as volumes and snapshots. It includes charges for storing and managing data within your clusters.

* **Network**: This part accounts for costs associated with data transfer, NAT gateways, and load balancers. It includes charges for network-related services and data movement.

* **Extended Support**: This category reflects additional charges incurred when your EKS clusters are not updated to the latest version. AWS applies these charges as a penalty for running outdated versions, which can include costs for extended support services.

* **Control Plane**: This section includes costs not classified under the above categories. It covers miscellaneous expenses related to the management and operation of your clusters.

### Number of Clusters ###

![copilot-eks-number-of-clusters.png](/tmpimg/copilot-eks-number-of-clusters.png)

The Number of Clusters card on the EKS page provides an overview of your clusters and their configuration status. This card helps you quickly assess how many clusters you have and their current setup. Here’s a breakdown of what each status means:
* **Configured**:
    - **Fully**: Displays the number of clusters where all necessary nOps agents and configurations are installed. For example, "Fully 5" indicates that 5 clusters have complete setup with all required agents and configurations on nOps Compute Copilot.
    - **BC+ Only**: Shows the number of clusters that have only the BC+ agent installed. For instance, "BC+ only 3" means that 3 clusters have the BC+ agent but do not have the Compute Copilot agent installed. 
    - **CC Only**: Represents clusters where Compute Copilot is configured, regardless of whether they use the Compute Copilot agent or not. For example, "CC Only 4" means that 4 clusters have Compute Copilot configured. Note that an agent is required only for clusters using Karpenter, not for those using Cluster Autoscaler.
* **Not Configured**: Represents clusters that have no configuration or agents installed. These clusters are not yet set up for monitoring or management.


### Container Utilization ###

{%include note.html content="Container Utilization metrics are available only for clusters with the [BC+ agent](https://www.nops.io/blog/introducing-business-contexts/) installed."%}

![copilot-eks-container-utilization.png](/tmpimg/copilot-eks-container-utilization.png)

The Container Utilization card on the EKS page provides an overview of how efficiently your cluster’s CPU and memory resources are being used. This card helps you monitor both utilization and excess for these resources, giving you insights into potential areas for optimization. Here’s how it works:

* **CPU Utilization**: A line graph indicating CPU utilization percentage and excess. The length of the blue line corresponds to the utilization percentage. Hovering over the line reveals detailed information, including requested CPU, used CPU, and excess CPU.

* **Memory Utilization**: A similar line graph for memory, showing the utilization percentage and excess. The blue line's length represents the memory utilization percentage. Hovering over the line shows requested memory, used memory, and excess memory.

### Compute Copilot Opportunities ###
