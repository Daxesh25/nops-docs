# Commitment Management Configuration #


If you're prefer to walk through configuring **Commitment Management** (CM) with nOps, please contact your nOps Sales representative.

If you'd prefer to configure on your own, please follow the steps outlined below.

## Prerequisites ##

1. Access to the management account of the AWS Organization
1. Ability to create and access a new email account or address (using an alias will work)


## Create an email address ##

In order to enroll in Commitment Management, you will need to create one email address for this purpose under the company domain, such as nops-cm@company.com.  If your email service uses aliasing, that will work too.  We recommend yourname+cm@company.com in that situation.

Follow your internal process to get access to your **nops-cm@** email account.

## Add a new AWS account to the AWS Organization ##

Login to your AWS management/payer account and follow the steps.

1. Navigate to the AWS Organization page.
2. Click on **Add an AWS account**

3. Add account information (we recommend _Company_ nOps CM for the name) using the new email address and click **Create AWS account**

## Configure the Payer roles ##
While the account creation processes, run the following [CloudFormation stack](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-1#/stacks/create/review?stackName=nops-sharesave-setup&templateURL=https://s3-external-1.amazonaws.com/cf-templates-1o8svzqapyba5-us-east-1/2022095DAy-nops-sharesave-setup4moad088den)

```
https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-1#/stacks/create/review?stackName=nops-sharesave-setup&templateURL=https://s3-external-1.amazonaws.com/cf-templates-1o8svzqapyba5-us-east-1/2022095DAy-nops-sharesave-setup4moad088den
```

You will need to enter 2 variables.


| **Report name**: |  **Bucket**: |
| --- | --- |
| _company_-cm | _company_-cm |



By now, you should receive confirmation the new account has been created.


### Create a Password for the new AWS account ###

1. Open [aws.amazon.com](https://aws.amazon.com)
1. Log in as a root user email
    1. Enter your nops-cm@company.com (or yourname+cm@company.com) email
    1. Click **Next**
    1. Click the _Forgot password?_ link
1. Reset your password


### Configure the new linked account ###

After logging into the linked account, run the following [CloudFormation stack](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-1#/stacks/create/review?stackName=nops-sharesave-roles&templateURL=https://s3-external-1.amazonaws.com/cf-templates-1o8svzqapyba5-us-east-1/2023353p12-nops_sharesavev2qp14lq7vf3)

```
https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-1#/stacks/create/review?stackName=nops-sharesave-roles&templateURL=https://s3-external-1.amazonaws.com/cf-templates-1o8svzqapyba5-us-east-1/2023353p12-nops_sharesavev2qp14lq7vf3
```

When this has completed and the stacks have run successfully, please contact nOps with the following information:

- Payer account number
- CM linked account number
- CM bucket name

And we can complete the configuration process on a short call.
